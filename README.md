## Git and GitHub

I've had some general idea about Git and basic concepts like commits, branches, merging and pull requests as I've had experience working in a development team as a tester. However how it all is done in practice seemed like rocket science to me (especially "scary" rebasing, cherry-picks and resolving merge conflicts). Now I see it is absolutely not :).  
Pretty much everything in the courses was **new to me**:

- making changes to commits with `git revert` and `git reset`
- working with remote repo with `git push`, `git fetch` and `git pull`
- juggling branches with `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git cherry-pick` etc.

**What surprised me** is how flexible Git is, as there is always a way to fix a mistake and it's quite hard to make a fatal one.

## Linux CLI and HTTP

Nothing was new to me in the [linuxsurvival](https://linuxsurvival.com/) course, because I'd already known most basic commands in linux CLI and used them in my work.

As for the articles on HTTP I found interesting the second part, where specifics of HTTP connections, identification, authentication and caching are revealed. Most of this information was new to me. All I was familiar with before were HTTP request methods, response codes and structure of request and response messages.

## Git Collaboration

In the course [GitHub & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456) and new levels of [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) I dug deeper into working with remote repositories and collaborating, via GitHub specifically.  
**What was new**:

- creating a connection to a remote repo with `git remote add origin <url>`
- details of forking and making a pull request in GitHub
- squashing commits with `git rebase -i`
- how to push (or fetch or pull) to different destinations with `git push origin <location>:<destination>`

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I already had knowledge of most of what is in these courses and used it in practice, but anyway it was useful to recall.  
**What was new**:

- CSS Grid. Compared to Flexbox it seems to be more appropriate when building a layout with many rows and columns and more convenient when you need high accuracy in managing sizes and position of elements
- CSS Transitions. It surprised me how animation with only css can be taken to another level :D

## Responsive Web Design

In Udacity course a lot was **new to me**:

- common responsive patterns: column drop, mostly fluid, layout shifter, off canvas
- picking breakpoints and using media queries `@media`
- setting the viewport `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`  
  I found content-based approach in picking breakpoints very useful and definitely going to use it in the future.

Also it was useful to recall flexbox properties.

## HTML & CSS Practice

[Demo](https://vakulinina.github.io/kottans-html-css-popup/) | [Code base](https://github.com/vakulinina/kottans-html-css-popup)  
It surprised me that this task could be done without JS code and it took me quite some time to come up with the solution. I also found tricky adding focus state to all of the interactive elements, although this part of the task had seemed the easiest :))

## JS Basics

What was new to me in Udacity course and FreeCodeCamp exercises:
- arrays, objects and their methods
- `doâ€¦while` loops
- difference between `let` and `var`
- rest parameter
- spread syntax
- destructuring assignment with arrays and objects
- principles of functional programming  

Intermediate algorithm scripting challenges were a little tough and made me understand all new things much better, going to finish the rest of them in the future.
